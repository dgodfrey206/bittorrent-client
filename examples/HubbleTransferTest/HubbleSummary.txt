HubbleSummary.txt:  Example test transfering a 6.76 MB JPEG file from Hubble.

The test was performed as follows:
1. Logged into four Yale Zoo nodes (Kangaroo, Chameleon, Dolphin, and Tick).
2. Ran the following commands, in this order:
    a. Kangaroo: $ java BitClient -z slow -x seed -w 7777 hubble.jpg.torrent
    b. Chameleon: $ java BitClient -z slow -p kangaroo.zoo.cs.yale.edu:7777 -w 7777 -s ./test/downloads/hubbleChameleon.jpg hubble.jpg.torrent
    c. Dolphin: $ java BitClient -z slow -w 7777 -p kangaroo.zoo.cs.yale.edu:7777 -p chameleon.zoo.cs.yale.edu:7777 -s ./test/downloads/hubbleDolphin.jpg hubble.jpg.torrent
    d. Tick: $ java BitClient -z slow -p kangaroo.zoo.cs.yale.edu:7777 -p chameleon.zoo.cs.yale.edu:7777 -p dolphin.zoo.cs.yale.edu:7777 -s ./test/downloads/hubbleTick.jpg hubble.jpg.torrent
This sets up a torrent to transfer slowly for ease of demonstration. Removing
the "-z slow" argument will make them all transfer at top speed. The results are:
    a. Kangaroo as a seeder listening on port 7777 (uploads from test/uploads/hubble.jpg)
    b. Chameleon as a leecher initially connected to Kangaroo
    c. Dolphin as a leecher initially connected to Kangaroo and Chameleon
    d. Tick as a leecher initially connected to Kangaroo, Chameleon, and Dolphin
3. The output can be found in the HubbleLeecherN.txt and HubbleSeeder.txt files.
We especially note the choking and unchoking, and the out-of-order transfer of
the file.
4. The resulting contents of the downloads folder were verified to be correct
as shown below:

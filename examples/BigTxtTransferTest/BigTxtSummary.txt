First we open up at least four nodes with distinct IP addresses. One of these
nodes must start with the test/uploads/big.txt file, and should be set up first.
We then start at least three separate nodes to the swarm. Once finished, all
four nodes have a copy of the file, which is verified below. The format of the
file names below is big<node>.txt, where <node> is the name of the zoo node that
was a leecher in the swarm:
